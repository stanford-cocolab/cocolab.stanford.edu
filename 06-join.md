# Are you interested in joining CoCoLab?

<br>
Anyone interested in joining CoCoLab should first get to know the research we do, for instance by reading some of our [publications](/publications).

<br>
**Potential postdocs**: We have very limited capacity for postdocs. If you believe there is an exceptional fit with the lab's work, please reach out to the PI.

**Potential graduate students**: We are accepting strong applicants in Computer Science or Psychology. Please apply through your respective department; there is no need to contact the PI before applying.

**Potential research assistants** (Stanford undergraduate or masters): Please send the PI or this mailing list (cocomentorship@lists.stanford.edu) an email with a current CV (including relevant research and programming experience), describe why you want to join the lab and what type of projects you are interested in. Please also indicate whether you are looking for a paid or a volunteer / course credit position.

**Potential research assistants** (non-Stanford): We are generally unable to accommodate research assistants from outside Stanford, except in exceptional cases. We may not be able to respond to all inquiries.

**High-school interns**: We are unable to take high-school students at this time.

<br>
If you'd like to receive **email announcements** from us about lab meetings, talks, and other interesting science updates, please sign up for our [mailing list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/cocolab-all).

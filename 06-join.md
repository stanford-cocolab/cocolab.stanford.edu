# Are you interested in joining CoCoLab?

<br>
Anyone interested in joining CoCoLab should first get to know the research we do, for instance by reading some of our [publications](/publications).

<br>
**Potential postdocs**: *Noah is on sabbatical for 2024-25 and will not be taking post-docs.*

**Potential graduate students**: *Noah is on sabbatical for 2024-25 and will not be accepting graduate students.*

**Potential research assistants** (Stanford undergraduate or masters): Please send the PI an email with a current CV (including relevant research and programming experience), describe why you want to join the lab and what type of projects you are interested in. Please also indicate whether you are looking for a paid or a volunteer / course credit position.

**Potential research assistants** (non-Stanford): Consider the <a href="https://www-csli.stanford.edu/csli-summer-internship-program-2021">Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI) Summer Intership</a>. We take very few interns that are not at Stanford (or on Stanford-sponsored programs). You may email the PI, but may not get a reply due to the large volume of requests.

**High-school interns**: We are unable to take high-school students at this time.

<br>
If you'd like to receive **email announcements** from us about lab meetings, talks, and other interesting science updates, please sign up for our [mailing list](https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/cocolab-all).

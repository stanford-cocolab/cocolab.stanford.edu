@article{degen2020redundancy,
	abstract = {Referring is one of the most basic and prevalent uses of language. How do speakers choose
from the wealth of referring expressions at their disposal? Rational theories of language use
have come under attack for decades for not being able to account for the seemingly irrational
overinformativeness ubiquitous in referring expressions. Here we present a novel production
model of referring expressions within the Rational Speech Act framework that treats speakers
as agents that rationally trade off cost and informativeness of utterances. Crucially, we relax the
assumption that informativeness is computed with respect to a deterministic Boolean semantics,
in favor of a non-deterministic continuous semantics. This innovation allows us to capture a large
number of seemingly disparate phenomena within one unified framework: the basic asymmetry
in speakers' propensity to overmodify with color rather than size; the increase in overmodification
in complex scenes; the increase in overmodification with atypical features; and the increase in
specificity in nominal reference as a function of typicality. These findings cast a new light on
the production of referring expressions: rather than being wastefully overinformative, reference
is usefully redundant.},

@article{Fan2019,
	abstract = {Visual modes of communication are ubiquitous in modern life---from maps to data plots to political cartoons. Here, we investigate drawing, the most basic form of visual communication. Participants were paired in an online environment to play a drawing-based reference game. On each trial, both participants were shown the same four objects, but in different locations. The sketcher's goal was to draw one of these objects so that the viewer could select it from the array. On ``close'' trials, objects belonged to the same basic-level category, whereas on ``far'' trials objects belonged to different categories. We found that people exploited shared information to efficiently communicate about the target object: on far trials, sketchers achieved high recognition accuracy while applying fewer strokes, using less ink, and spending less time on their drawings than on close trials. We hypothesized that humans succeed in this task by recruiting two core faculties: visual abstraction, the ability to perceive the correspondence between an object and a drawing of it; and pragmatic inference, the ability to judge what information would help a viewer distinguish the target from distractors. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a computational model of the sketcher that embodied both faculties, instantiated as a deep convolutional neural network nested within a probabilistic program. We found that this model fit human data well and outperformed lesioned variants. Together, this work provides the first algorithmically explicit theory of how visual perception and social cognition jointly support contextual flexibility in visual communication.},

@inproceedings{Hawkins2019GraphicalCF,
	abstract = {Drawing is a versatile technique for visual communication, ranging from photorealistic renderings to schematic diagrams consisting entirely of symbols. How does a medium spanning such a broad range of appearances reliably convey meaning? A natural possibility is that drawings derive meaning from both their visual properties as well as shared knowledge between people who use them to communicate. Here we evaluate this possibility in a drawing-based reference game in which two participants repeatedly communicated about visual objects. Across a series of controlled experiments, we found that pairs of participants discover increasingly sparse yet effective ways of depicting objects. These gains were specific to those objects that were repeatedly referenced, and went beyond what could be explained by task practice or the visual properties of the drawings alone. We employed modern techniques from computer vision to characterize how the high-level visual features of drawings changed, finding that drawings of the same object became more consistent within a pair of participants and divergent across participants from different pairs. Taken together, these findings suggest that visual communication promotes the emergence of depictions whose meanings are increasingly determined by shared knowledge rather than their visual properties alone.},

Explanations are challenging in that they require many different forms of abstract knowledge and reasoning. Previous work has either relied on human-curated structured knowledge bases or detailed domain representation to generate satisfactory explanations. They are also often limited to ranking pre-existing explanation choices. In our work, we contribute to the under-explored area of generating natural language explanations for general phenomena. We automatically collect large datasets of explanation-phenomenon pairs which allow us to train sequence-to-sequence models to generate natural language explanations. We compare different training strategies and evaluate their performance using both automatic scores and human ratings. We demonstrate that our strategy is sufficient to generate highly plausible explanations for general open-domain phenomena compared to other models trained on different datasets.},

We show that our curated dataset provides an excellent signal for learning vector representations of sentence meaning, representing relations that can only be determined when the meanings of two sentences are combined. We demonstrate that the automatically curated corpus allows a bidirectional LSTM sentence encoder to yield high quality sentence embeddings and can serve as a supervised fine-tuning dataset for larger models such as BERT.

@article{OngEtAl19,
	abstract = {Affective Computing is a rapidly growing field spurred by advancements in artificial intelligence, but often, held back by the inability to translate psychological theories of emotion into tractable computational models. To address this, we propose a probabilistic programming approach to affective computing, which models psychological-grounded theories as generative models of emotion, and implements them as stochastic, executable computer programs. We first review probabilistic approaches that integrate reasoning about emotions with reasoning about other latent mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires) in context. Recently-developed probabilistic programming languages offer several key desidarata over previous approaches, such as: (i) flexibility in representing emotions and emotional processes; (ii) modularity and compositionality; (iii) integration with deep learning libraries that facilitate efficient inference and learning from large, naturalistic data; and (iv) ease of adoption. Furthermore, using a probabilistic programming framework allows a standardized platform for theory-building and experimentation: Competing theories (e.g., of appraisal or other emotional processes) can be easily compared via modular substitution of code followed by model comparison. To jumpstart adoption, we illustrate our points with executable code that researchers can easily modify for their own models. We end with a discussion of applications and future directions of the probabilistic programming approach},

	Abstract = {What makes a question useful? What makes an answer helpful? Asking questions is one of our most efficient and reliable means of learning about the world. Yet we do not often pose these questions to an impartial oracle; we ask other agents, in dialogue. In this paper, we reconcile formal models of optimal question-asking with classic psycholinguistic effects of social context by extending recent probabilistic cognitive models of goal-relevant communication to dialogue. Agents hear an utterance, update their beliefs through social reasoning, and select an utterance in response. The utility of producing a question in this framework is the expected reduction in uncertainty about the aspects of the world relevant to the speaker's goal upon hearing an answer from their partner. Critically, this suggests that the question itself can be a signal to the speaker's underlying goals, and that a helpful answerer should be informative with respect to inferred goals, beyond the literal meaning of the question. We compare models of both the questioner and answerer within this framework based on three pieces of evidence: First, we account for classic effects in psycholinguistics showing that the same question can yield different answers depending on the context. Second, we run a real-time, multi-player communication game to jointly test predictions made by the questioner and answerer components of our model. Third, we show that the salience of goals affects both asking and answering questions. We find that sophisticated pragmatic reasoning in dialogue is needed to account for critical aspects of the data.},

By contrast, there has been less work on modeling observers' understanding of emotional states. We propose an intuitive theory framework to studying affective cognition---how humans reason about emotions---and derive a taxonomy of inferences within affective cognition. Using this taxonomy, we review formal computational modeling work on such inferences, including: causal reasoning about how others react to events, reasoning about unseen causes of emotions, reasoning with multiple cues, as well as reasoning from emotions to other mental states. Additionally, we provide a roadmap for future research by charting out inferences---such as hypothetical and counterfactual reasoning about emotions---that are ripe for future computational modeling work. This framework proposes unifying these various types of reasoning as Bayesian inference within a common ``intuitive Theory of Emotion''. Finally, we end with a discussion of important theoretical and methodological challenges that lie ahead in modeling affective cognition.},

	abstract = {Bayesian models of cognition assume that people compute probability distributions over hypotheses. However, the required computations are frequently intractable or prohibitively expensive. Since people often encounter many closely related distributions, selective reuse of computations (amortized inference) is a computationally efficient use of the brain's limited resources. We present three experiments that provide evidence for amortization in human probabilistic reasoning. When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, participants' responses to the second query systematically depend on the structure of the first query. This influence is sensitive to the content of the queries, only appearing when the queries are related. Using a cognitive load manipulation, we find evidence that people amortize summary statistics of previous inferences, rather than storing the entire distribution. These findings support the view that the brain trades off accuracy and computational cost, to make efficient use of its limited cognitive resources to approximate probabilistic inference. },

We then describe a rational model of adjective use in which listeners explicitly reason about judgments made by different speakers, formalizing the notion of subjectivity as agreement between speakers. We show that, once incremental processing is combined with memory limitations, our model predicts effects both of subjectivity and mutual information. We confirm the adequacy of our model by evaluating it on corpus data, finding that it correctly predicts ordering in unseen data with an accuracy of 96.2\%. This suggests that adjective ordering can be explained by general principles of human communication and language processing.},

Here, we explore this question by having people attribute emotions to themselves and others following simple gambles. We demonstrate that people display an emotional self-enhancement bias that varies with the context of the emotion-eliciting situation. People judge themselves as experiencing more positive emotional reactions on average, and they also believed that others' emotions are more sensitive to gamble outcomes, such that people judge others to experience stronger negative affect in response to negative outcomes (Study 1). This self-enhancement bias further tracks social distance, such that people attribute less positive and more negative emotion to more dissimilar, as compared to more similar others (Study 2). People also predict less favorable emotional states for themselves and others experiencing events in the future, as compared to the present (Study 3), suggesting that this attribution bias extends across multiple dimensions of psychological distance. Broadly, these data suggest that people exhibit self-enhancement in emotion attribution, but do so in subtle ways that depend on situational and social factors.},

Recent computational theories of language evolution suggest that communicative demands of the environment may play a deciding role. We hypothesize that language users are more likely to lexicalize specific names (e.g. Fido) when the context frequently requires making fine distinctions between entities; conversely, they should develop a more compressed system of conventions for abstract categories (e.g. dog) in coarser contexts. We test this hypothesis by manipulating context in a repeated reference game where pairs of participants interactively coordinate on an artificial communication system. We show qualitative differences in the levels of abstraction that emerged in different contexts and introduce a statistical approach to probe the dynamics of emergence. These findings illuminate the local pragmatic learning mechanisms that may drive global language evolution.},

that make relatively strong assumptions about a subset of interpretable variables and rely on
the flexibility of neural networks to learn representations for the remaining variables. We
further define a general objective for semi-supervised learning in this model class, which can be
approximated using an importance sampling procedure. We evaluate our framework's ability

	abstract = {Learning what others know, especially experts, is a crucial shortcut to understanding the world. Other people's actions and utterances are thus a powerful source of evidence. However, people do not simply copy others' choices or stated beliefs; rather, they infer what others believe and integrate these beliefs with their own. In this paper, we present a computational account of the inference and integration process that underpins learning from a combination of social and direct evidence. This account formalizes the learner's intuitive understanding of psychology---or theory of mind (ToM)---including attributes such as confidence, reliability, and knowledgeability. It then shows how ToM is the lens used to interpret another person's choices, weighing them against the learner's own direct evidence. To test this account, we develop an experimental paradigm that allows for graded manipulation of social and direct evidence, and for quantitative measurement of the learner's resulting beliefs. Four experiments test the predictions of the model, manipulating knowledgeability, confidence, and reliability of the social source. Learners' behavior is consistent with our quantitative and qualitative model predictions across all 4 experiments, demonstrating subtle interactions between evidence and the attributes of those learned from.},

Such agents are the basis for current computational models of Theory of Mind (ToM), but the accuracy of these models are unknown. Do people really think that others do not let their desires color their beliefs? In two experiments we test whether people think that others engage in wishful thinking. We find that participants do think others believe that desirable events are more likely to happen, and that undesirable ones are less likely to happen. However, these beliefs are not well calibrated as people do not let their desires influence their beliefs in the task. Whether accurate or not, thinking that others wishfully think has consequences for reasoning about them. We find one such consequence---people learn more from an informant who thinks an event will happen despite wishing it was otherwise. People's ToM therefore appears to be more nuanced than the current rational accounts in that it allows other's desires to directly affect their subjective probability of an event. },

This paper investigates the role of context in the disambiguation of plural predication. We address the key phenomenon of ``stubborn distributivity,'' whereby certain predicates (e.g., big, tall) are claimed to lack collective interpretations altogether. We first validate a new methodology for measuring the interpretation of plural predications. Using this method, we then analyze naturally-occurring plural predications from corpora. We find a role of context, but no evidence of a distinct class of predicates that resists collective interpretations. We further explore the role of context in our final experiments, showing that both the predictability of properties and the knowledgeability of the speaker affect disambiguation. This suggests a pragmatic account of how ambiguous plural predications are interpreted. In particular, stubbornly distributive predicates are so because the collective properties they name are unpredictable, or unstable, in most contexts; this unpredictability results in a noisy collective interpretation, something speakers and listeners recognize as ineffective for communicating efficiently about their world. We formalize the pragmatics of utterance disambiguation within the Bayesian Rational Speech Act framework.},

We tracked participants' eye-movements while they judged whether one billiard ball caused another one to go through a gate, or prevented it from going through. Both participants' looking patterns and judgments demonstrate that counterfactual simulation is critical. Participants simulate where the target ball would have gone if the candidate cause had been removed from the scene. The more certain participants were that the outcome would have been different, the stronger their causal judgments.

To answer this question, we applied a mathematical theory of bounded rationality to the problem of numerical estimation.

This model provided a unifying explanation for ten anchoring phenomena including the differential effect of accuracy motivation on the bias towards provided versus self-generated anchors.

This anchoring bias is usually interpreted as sign of human irrationality, but it has recently been suggested that the anchoring bias instead results from people's rational use of their finite time and limited cognitive resources. If this were true, then adjustment should decrease with the relative cost of time. To test this hypothesis, we designed a new numerical estimation paradigm that controls people's knowledge and varies the cost of time and error independently while allowing people to invest as much or as little time and effort into refining their estimate as they wish. Two experiments confirmed the prediction that adjustment decreases with time cost but increases with error cost regardless of whether the anchor was self-generated or provided. These results support the hypothesis that people rationally adapt their number of adjustments to achieve a near-optimal speed-accuracy tradeoff.

Experiments show that this combined pragmatic model interprets color descriptions more accurately than the classifiers from which it is built. We observe that pragmatic reasoning helps primarily in the hardest cases: when the model must distinguish very similar colors, or when few utterances adequately express the target color. Our findings make use of a newly-collected corpus of human utterances in color reference games, which exhibit a variety of pragmatic behaviors. We also show that the embedded speaker model reproduces many of these pragmatic behaviors.},

	abstract = {Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a powerful modeling tool, able to represent any computable probability distribution. Unfortunately, probabilistic program inference is often intractable, and existing PPLs mostly rely on expensive, approximate sampling-based methods. To alleviate this problem, one could try to learn from past inferences, so that future inferences run faster. This strategy is known as amortized inference; it has recently been applied to Bayesian networks and deep generative models. This paper proposes a system for amortized inference in PPLs. In our system, amortization comes in the form of a parameterized guide program. Guide programs have similar structure to the original program, but can have richer data flow, including neural network components. These networks can be optimized so that the guide approximately samples from the posterior distribution defined by the original program. We present a flexible interface for defining guide programs and a stochastic gradient-based scheme for optimizing guide parameters, as well as some preliminary results on automatically deriving guide programs. We explore in detail the common machine learning pattern in which a `local' model is specified by `global' random values and used to generate independent observed data points; this gives rise to amortized local inference supporting global model learning.},

But we need not comb this space by hand - if we represent our theories as formal models and explicitly declare the space of experiments, we can automate the search for good experiments, looking for those with high expected information gain. Here, we present a general and principled approach to experiment design based on probabilistic programming languages (PPLs). PPLs offer a clean separation between declaring problems and solving them, which means that the scientist can automate experiment design by simply declaring her model and experiment spaces in the PPL without having to worry about the details of calculating information gain. We demonstrate our system in two case studies drawn from cognitive psychology, where we use it to design optimal experiments in the domains of sequence prediction and categorization. We find strong empirical validation that our automatically designed experiments were indeed optimal. We conclude by discussing a number of interesting questions for future research.},

These results motivate a theory of convention-formation where agents, though initially uncertain about word meanings in context, assume others are using language with such knowledge. Thus, agents may learn about meanings by reasoning about a knowledgeable, informative partner; if all agents engage in such a process, they successfully coordinate their beliefs, giving rise to a conventional communication system. We formalize this theory in a computational model of language understanding as social inference and demonstrate that it produces all three signatures.},

When sequentially answering two related queries about natural scenes, we show that answers to the second query vary systematically depending on the structure of the first query.

One hypothesis is that people expect others to choose what to say based on their goals both to transfer information efficiently (an epistemic goal) and to make the listener feel good (a social goal). In our previous work, we found that when these two goals conflict, they sometimes produce white lies. In the current work, we expand on this theory to consider another prominent case of polite speech: indirect remarks using negation (e.g., "It wasn't amazing"). With minimal extensions from our previous framework, our formal model suggests that a pragmatic speaker will produce more indirect remarks when the speaker wants to be informative and seem considerate at the same time. These predictions were borne out in an experiment on language production. These findings suggest that the conflict between social and epistemic goals can account for a broad range of politeness phenomena.},

Warm vaguely conveys that the temperature is high relative to some contextual comparison class, but little is known about how a listener decides upon such a standard of comparison. Here, we propose that the resolution of a comparison class in context is a pragmatic inference driven by world knowledge and listeners' internal models of speech production. We introduce a Rational Speech Act model and derive two novel predictions from it, which we validate using a paraphrase experiment to measure listeners' beliefs about the likely comparison class used by a speaker. Our model makes quantitative predictions given prior world knowledge for the domains in question.

There are two main approaches to account for projection phenomena. The semantic approach adds restrictions of the common ground to the conventional meaning. The pragmatic approach tries to derive projection from general conversational principles. In this paper we build a probabilistic model of language understanding in which the listener jointly infers the world state and what common ground the speaker has assumed.

Under certain assumptions, the model predicts the projective behavior and its interaction with the question under discussion (QUD), without any special semantic treatment of projective content.},

@article{OngEtAl2015-Cognition,
	abstract = {Humans skillfully reason about others' emotions, a phenomenon we term affective cognition. Despite its importance, few formal, quantitative theories have described the mechanisms supporting this phenomenon. We propose that affective cognition involves applying domain-general reasoning processes to domain-specific content knowledge. Observers' knowledge about emotions is represented in rich and coherent lay theories, which comprise consistent relationships between situations, emotions, and behaviors. Observers utilize this knowledge in deciphering social agents' behavior and signals (e.g., facial expressions), in a manner similar to rational inference in other domains. We construct a computational model of a lay theory of emotion, drawing on tools from Bayesian statistics, and test this model across four experiments in which observers drew inferences about others' emotions in a simple gambling paradigm. This work makes two main contributions. First, the model accurately captures observers' flexible but consistent reasoning about the ways that events and others' emotional responses to those events relate to each other. Second, our work models the problem of emotional cue integration---reasoning about others' emotion from multiple emotional cues---as rational inference via Bayes' rule, and we show that this model tightly tracks human observers' empirical judgments. Our results reveal a deep structural relationship between affective cognition and other forms of inference, and suggest wide-ranging applications to basic psychological theory and psychiatry.},

We discuss two phenomena which pose a challenge to these accounts of pragmatics: M-implicatures (Horn, 1984) and embedded implicatures which violate Hurford's constraint (Chierchia, Fox & Spector, 2012; Hurford, 1974). Previous models cannot derive these implicatures, because of basic limitations in their architecture. In order to explain these phenomena, we propose a realignment of the division between semantic content and pragmatic content. Under this proposal, the semantic content of an utterance is not fixed independent of pragmatic inference; rather, pragmatic inference partially determines an utterance's semantic content. We show how semantic inference can be realized as an extension to the Rational Speech Acts framework (Goodman & Stuhlm\"uller, 2013). The addition of lexical uncertainty derives both M-implicatures and the relevant embedded implicatures, and preserves the derivations of more standard implicatures.},

We propose two approximations that complement the top-down Bayesian approach. One approximation model relies on a more bottom-up feature-based inference scheme.

Although this is certainly true during the earliest stages of phonological development, once a child possesses the basic articulatory skills required for imitation, it need not necessarily be the case. A child could produce a word without possessing the fully formed lexical representation through imitation. In some cases, such as in response to questions containing fixed choices, this behavior could be mistaken for a deeper understanding of the words' semantic content. In this paper, we present evidence that 2to 3-year-old children exhibit a robust recency bias when verbally responding to two-alternative choice questions (i.e., they select the second, most recently mentioned option), possibly due to the availability of the second word in phonological memory. We find further evidence of this effect outside of a laboratory setting in naturalistic conversational contexts in CHILDES (MacWhinney, 2000), a large corpus of transcribed child-adult interactions.},

Such agents are the basis for current computational models of Theory of Mind (ToM), but this fundamental assumption of the theory remains untested. Do people think that others' beliefs are objective, or do they think that others' desires color their beliefs? We describe a Bayesian framework for exploring this relationship and its implications. Motivated by this analysis, we conducted two experiments testing the a priori independence of beliefs and desires in people's ToM and find that, contrary to fully-normative accounts, people think that others engage in wishful thinking. In the first experiment, we found that people think others believe both that desirable events are more likely to happen, and that undesirable ones are less likely to happen. In the second experiment, we found that social learning leverages this intuitive understanding of wishful thinking: participants learned more from the beliefs of an informant whose desires were contrary to his beliefs. People's ToM therefore appears to be more nuanced than the current rational accounts, but consistent with a model in which desire directly affects the subjective probability of an event.},

We provide a probabilistic model of reasoning with modal expressions such as "necessary" and "plausible" informed by recent work in formal semantics of natural language, and show that it predicts the possibility of non-linear response patterns which have been claimed to be problematic. Our model also makes a strong monotonicity prediction, while two-dimensional theories predict the possibility of reversals in argument strength depending on the modal word chosen. Predictions were tested using a novel experimental paradigm that replicates the previously-reported response patterns with a minimal manipulation, changing only one word of the stimulus between conditions. We found a spectrum of reasoning "modes" corresponding to different modal words, and strong support for our model's monotonicity prediction. This indicates that probabilistic approaches to reasoning can account in a clear and parsimonious way for data previously argued to falsify them, as well as new, more fine-grained, data. It also illustrates the importance of careful attention to the semantics of language employed in reasoning experiments.},

Our predictive representations have two key properties: they are productive, and they are graded. Productive generalization is possible because our knowledge decomposes into concepts -- elements of knowledge that are combined and recombined to describe particular situations. Gradedness is the observable effect of accounting for uncertainty -- our knowledge encodes degrees of belief that lead to graded probabilistic predictions. To put this a different way, concepts form a combinatorial system that enables description of many different situations; each such situation specifies a distribution over what we expect to see in the world, given what we have seen. We may think of this system as a probabilistic language of thought (PLoT) in which representations are built from language-like composition of concepts and the content of those representations is a probability distribution on world states. The purpose of this chapter is to formalize these ideas in computational terms, to illustrate key properties of the PLoT approach with a concrete example, and to draw connections with other views of conceptual structure.},

We find a curious dual trend: if information is costless, as the probability of the event increases people want the information more; if information is not costless, people's desire for the information peaks at an intermediate probability. People also want information more as the importance of the event increases, and less as the cost of the information increases.

Inferences of this sort are difficult for young children, but recent work suggests that this mismatch may stem from issues in understanding the relationship between lexical items like "some" and "all," rather than broader pragmatic deficits. We tested children's ability to make non-quantificational pragmatic inferences by constructing contextually-derived "ad-hoc" implicatures, using sets of pictures with contrasting features. We found that four-year-olds and some three-year-olds were able to make implicatures successfully using these displays.

We argue that the brain operates in the setting of amortized inference, where numerous related queries must be answered (e.g., recognizing a scene from multiple viewpoints); in this setting, memoryless algorithms can be computationally wasteful. We propose a simple form of flexible reuse, according to which shared inferences are cached and composed together to answer new queries. We present experimental evidence that humans exploit this form of reuse: the answer to a complex query can be systematically predicted from a person's response to a simpler query if the simpler query was presented first and entails a sub-inference (i.e., a sub-component of the more complex query). People are also faster at answering a complex query when it is preceded by a sub-inference.

Flexible human cognition is derived in large part from our ability to imagine possible worlds. A rich set of concepts, intuitive theories, and other mental representations support imagining and reasoning about possible worlds -- together we call these core cognition. Here we posit that the collection of core concepts also forms the set of primitive elements available for lexical semantics: word meanings are built from pieces of core cognition. We propose to study lexical semantics in the setting of an architecture for language understanding that integrates literal meaning with pragmatic inference. This architecture supports underspecified and uncertain lexical meaning, leading to subtle interactions between meaning, conceptual structure, and context. We will explore several cases of lexical semantics where these interactions are particularly important: indexicals, scalar adjectives, generics, and modals. We formalize both core cognition and the natural language architecture using the Church probabilistic programming language.

However, a number of findings have highlighted an intriguing mismatch between human behavior and standard assumptions about optimality: People often appear to make decisions based on just one or a few samples from the appropriate posterior probability distribution, rather than using the full distribution. Although sampling-based approximations are a common way to implement Bayesian inference, the very limited numbers of samples often used by humans seem insufficient to approximate the required probability distributions very accurately. Here, we consider this discrepancy in the broader framework of statistical decision theory, and ask: If people are making decisions based on samples --  but as samples are costly -- how many samples should people use to optimize their total expected or worst-case reward over a large number of decisions? We find that under reasonable assumptions about the time costs of sampling, making many quick but locally suboptimal decisions based on very few samples may be the globally optimal strategy over long periods. These results help to reconcile a large body of work showing sampling-based or probability matching behavior with the hypothesis that human cognition can be understood in Bayesian terms, and they suggest promising future directions for studies of resource-constrained cognition.},

Our algorithms accumulate information to estimate the local conditional distributions that constitute such a factorization. These stochastic inverses can be used to invert each of the computation steps leading to an observation, sampling backwards in order to quickly find a likely explanation. We show that estimated inverses converge asymptotically in number of (prior or posterior) training samples.

Generalization, thus, is at the core of the learned helplessness phenomenon. Substantial experimental and theoretical effort has been invested into establishing that a state- and task-independent belief about controllability is necessary. However, to what extent generalization is also sufficient to explain the transfer has not been examined. Here, we show qualitatively and quantitatively that Bayesian learning of action-outcome contingencies at three levels of abstraction is sufficient to account for the key features of learned helplessness, including escape deficits and impairment of appetitive learning after inescapable shocks.},

Therefore minds and machines have to approximate Bayesian inference. Approximate inference algorithms can achieve a wide range of time-accuracy tradeoffs, but what is the optimal tradeoff? We investigate timeaccuracy tradeoffs using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm as a metaphor for the mind's inference algorithm(s). We characterize the optimal time-accuracy tradeoff mathematically in terms of the number of iterations and the resulting bias as functions of time cost, error cost, and the difficulty of the inference problem. We find that reasonably accurate decisions are possible long before the Markov chain has converged to the posterior distribution, i.e. during the period known as "burn-in". Therefore the strategy that is optimal subject to the mind's bounded processing speed and opportunity costs may perform so few iterations that the resulting samples are biased towards the initial value. The resulting cognitive process model provides a rational basis for the anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic. The model's quantitative predictions match published data on anchoring in numerical estimation tasks. In conclusion, resource-rationality -- the optimal use of finite computational resources -- naturally leads to a biased mind.},

In particular, our method addresses the challenge of synthesizing open world layouts where the number of objects are not fixed and optimal configurations for different numbers of objects may be drastically different.

Motivated by previous approaches to model merging and program induction, we search for such explanatory abstractions using program transformations. We consider two types of transformation: Abstraction merges common subexpressions within a program into new functions (a form of anti-unification). Deargumentation simplifies functions by reducing the number of arguments. We demonstrate that this approach finds key patterns in the domain of nested lists, including parameterized sub-functions and stochastic recursion.},

In Experiment 1, we investigated children's exploratory play after an adult pedagogically demonstrated a function of a toy, after an interrupted pedagogical demonstration, after a na{\"\i}ve adult demonstrated the function, and at baseline. Preschoolers in the pedagogical condition focused almost exclusively on the target function; by contrast, children in the other conditions explored broadly. In Experiment 2, we show that children restrict their exploration both after direct instruction to themselves and after overhearing direct instruction given to another child; they do not show this constraint after observing direct instruction given to an adult or after observing a non-pedagogical intentional action. We discuss these findings as the result of rational inductive biases. In pedagogical contexts, a teacher's failure to provide evidence for additional functions provides evidence for their absence; such contexts generalize from child to child (because children are likely to have comparable states of knowledge) but not from adult to child. Thus, pedagogy promotes efficient learning but at a cost: children are less likely to perform potentially irrelevant actions but also less likely to discover novel information.},

@article{chater2011imaginary,
	abstract = {The prominence of Bayesian modeling of cognition has increased recently largely because of mathematical advances in specifying and deriving predictions from complex probabilistic models. Much of this research aims to demonstrate that cognitive behavior can be explained from rational principles alone, without recourse to psychological or neurological processes and representations. We note commonalities between this rational approach and other movements in psychology -- namely, Behaviorism and evolutionary psychology -- that set aside mechanistic explanations or make use of optimality assumptions. Through these comparisons, we identify a number of challenges that limit the rational program's potential contribution to psychological theory. Specifically, rational Bayesian models are significantly unconstrained, both because they are uninformed by a wide range of process-level data and because their assumptions about the environment are generally not grounded in empirical measurement. The psychological implications of most Bayesian models are also unclear. Bayesian inference itself is conceptually trivial, but strong assumptions are often embedded in the hypothesis sets and the approximation algorithms used to derive model predictions, without a clear delineation between psychological commitments and implementational details. Comparing multiple Bayesian models of the same task is rare, as is the realization that many Bayesian models recapitulate existing (mechanistic level) theories. Despite the expressive power of current Bayesian models, we argue they must be developed in conjunction with mechanistic considerations to offer substantive explanations of cognition. We lay out several means for such an integration, which take into account the representations on which Bayesian inference operates, as well as the algorithms and heuristics that carry it out. We argue this unification will better facilitate lasting contributions to psychological theory, avoiding the pitfalls that have plagued previous theoretical movements.},

Using ideas from planning-as-inference reductions and Bayesian unsupervised learning, we cast Markov Chain Monte Carlo as a stochastic, hill-climbing policy search algorithm. Importantly, this algorithm's search bias is directly tied to the prior and its MCMC proposal kernels, which means we can draw on the full Bayesian toolbox to express the search bias, including nonparametric priors and structured, recursive processes like grammars over action sequences. Furthermore, we can reason about uncertainty in the search bias itself by constructing a hierarchical prior and reasoning about latent variables that determine the abstract structure of the policy. This yields an adaptive search algorithm -- our algorithm learns to learn a structured policy efficiently. We show how inference over the latent variables in these policy priors enables intra- and intertask transfer of abstract knowledge. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach by learning meta search biases, by constructing a nonparametric finite state controller to model memory, by discovering motor primitives using a simple grammar over primitive actions, and by combining all three.},

These behaviors are advantageous in allowing sequential behaviors to be performed without cognitive overload, and appear to rely on neural circuits that are relatively benign but vulnerable to takeover by extreme contexts, neuropsychiatric sequelae, and processes leading to addiction. Reinforcement learning (RL) is thought to underlie the formation of optimal habits. However, this theoretic formulation has principally been tested experimentally in simple stimulus-response tasks with relatively few available responses. We asked whether RL could also account for the emergence of habitual action sequences in realistically complex situations in which no repetitive stimulus-response links were present and in which many response options were present. We exposed naive macaque monkeys to such experimental conditions by introducing a unique free saccade scan task. Despite the highly uncertain conditions and no instruction, the monkeys developed a succession of stereotypical, self-chosen saccade sequence patterns. Remarkably, these continued to morph for months, long after session-averaged reward and cost (eye movement distance) reached asymptote. Prima facie, these continued behavioral changes appeared to challenge RL. However, trial-by-trial analysis showed that pattern changes on adjacent trials were predicted by lowered cost, and RL simulations that reduced the cost reproduced the monkeys' behavior. Ultimately, the patterns settled into stereotypical saccade sequences that minimized the cost of obtaining the reward on average. These findings suggest that brain mechanisms underlying the emergence of habits, and perhaps unwanted repetitive behaviors in clinical disorders, could follow RL algorithms capturing extremely local explore/exploit tradeoffs.},

	abstract = {A picture may be worth a thousand words, but its description will likely use far fewer. How do speakers choose which aspects of a complex image to describe? Grice's pragmatic maxims (e.g., ``be relevant'', ``be informative'') have served as an informal guide for understanding how speakers select which pieces of information to include in descriptions. We present a formalization of Grice's maxim of informativeness (``choose descriptions proportional to the number of bits they convey about the referent with respect to context'') and test its ability to capture human performance.

Experiment 1: Participants saw sets of four simple objects that varied on two dimensions (e.g., texture and shape) and were asked to provide the relative probabilities of using two different adjectives (e.g., polka-dot vs. square) to describe a target object relative to the distractor objects. Participants' mean probabilities were highly correlated with the information theoretic model's predictions for the relative informativeness of the two adjectives (r=.92,p<.0001).

Experiment 2: Participants described street scenes from a database of hand-segmented and labeled images (LabelMe). In the context condition, participants were presented with a set of six scenes, one target and five distractors, and were asked to name five objects in the target scene so that another observer could pick that scene out of the set. In the no-context condition, another group of participants performed the same task without seeing the distractors. The information-theoretic model was strongly correlated with differences in object labeling between context and no-context conditions (r=.67,p<.0001), suggesting that the model captures the effect of context on descriptor choice.

Our results suggest that speakers' image descriptions conform to optimal pragmatic norms and that information theory can define norms for the linguistic compression of visual information. This constitutes a first step towards understanding how the visual world is captured and communicated by language users.},

	abstract = {In many learning or inference tasks human behavior approximates that of a Bayesian ideal observer, suggesting that, at some level, cognition can be described as Bayesian inference. However, a number of findings have highlighted an intriguing mismatch between human behavior and standard assumptions about optimality: People often appear to make decisions based on just one or a few samples from the appropriate posterior probability distribution, rather than using the full distribution. Although sampling-based approximations are a common way to implement Bayesian inference, the very limited numbers of samples often used by humans seem insufficient to approximate the required probability distributions very accurately. Here, we consider this discrepancy in the broader framework of statistical decision theory, and ask: If people are making decisions based on samples -- but as samples are costly -- how many samples should people use to optimize their total expected or worst-case reward over a large number of decisions? We find that under reasonable assumptions about the time costs of sampling, making many quick but locally suboptimal decisions based on very few samples may be the globally optimal strategy over long periods. These results help to reconcile a large body of work showing sampling-based or probability matching behavior with the hypothesis that human cognition can be understood in Bayesian terms, and they suggest promising future directions for studies of resource-constrained cognition.},

	abstract = {Word learning is a "chicken and egg" problem. If a child could understand speakers' utterances, it would be easy to learn the meanings of individual words, and once a child knows what many words mean, it is easy to infer speakers' intended meanings. To the beginning learner, however, both individual word meanings and speakers' intentions are unknown. We describe a computational model of word learning that solves these two inference problems in parallel, rather than relying exclusively on either the inferred meanings of utterances or cross-situational word-meaning associations. We tested our model using annotated corpus data and found that it inferred pairings between words and object concepts with higher precision than comparison models. Moreover, as the result of making probabilistic inferences about speakers' intentions, our model explains a variety of behavioral phenomena described in the word-learning literature. These phenomena include mutual exclusivity, one-trial learning, cross-situational learning, the role of words in object individuation, and the use of inferred intentions to disambiguate reference.},

Here we propose a formal analogue to these accounts: that communicators choose what they want to say by how informative it would be about their intended meaning. We derive quantitative predictions about how this assumption would be used in language production and learning and test these predictions via two experiments.

Achieving these three desiderata simultaneously is nontrivial. Expressivity can be achieved by using a formalism similar to a programming language, but standard approaches to combining programming languages with probabilities sacrifice random-world semantics. Naive approaches to restoring random-world semantics undermine syntactic independence criteria. Our main result is a syntactic independence criterion that holds for a broad class of highly expressive logics under random-world semantics. We explore various examples including Bayesian networks, probabilistic context-free grammars, and an example from Mendelian genetics. Our independence criterion supports a case-factor inference technique that reproduces both variable elimination for BNs and the inside algorithm for PCFGs.},

Here we show that preschoolers (mean: 57 months) can use sparse data about perceptually unique objects to infer abstract physical causal laws. These newly inferred abstract laws were robust to potentially anomalous evidence; in the face of apparent counter-evidence, children (correctly) posited the existence of an unobserved object rather than revise the abstract laws. This suggests that children's ability to learn robust, abstract principles does not depend on extensive prior experience but can occur rapidly, on-line, and in tandem with inferences about specific relations.},

	abstract = {Rational analysis attempts to explain aspects of human cognition as an adaptive response to the environment (Marr, 1982; Anderson, 1990; Chater, Tenenbaum, & Yuille, 2006). The dominant approach to rational analysis today takes an ecologically reasonable specification of a problem facing an organism, given in statistical terms, then seeks an optimal solution, usually using Bayesian methods. This approach has proven very successful in cognitive science; it has predicted perceptual phenomena (Geisler & Kersten, 2002; Feldman, 2001), illuminated puzzling effects in reasoning (Chater & Oaksford, 1999; Griffiths & Tenenbaum, 2006), and, especially, explained how human learning can succeed despite sparse input and endemic uncertainty (Tenenbaum, 1999; Tenenbaum & Griffiths, 2001). However, there were earlier notions of the "rational" analysis of cognition that emphasized very different ideas. One of the central ideas behind logical and computational approaches, which previously dominated notions of rationality, is that meaning can be captured in the structure of representations, but that compositional semantics are needed for these representations to provide a coherent account of thought. In this chapter we attempt to reconcile the modern approach to rational analysis with some aspects of this older, logico-computational approach. We do this via a model---offered as an extended example---of human concept learning. In the current chapter we are primarily concerned with formal aspects of this approach; in other work (Goodman, Tenenbaum, Feldman, & Griffiths, in press) we more carefully study a variant of this model as a psychological model of human concept learning.},

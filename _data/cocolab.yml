          My research goal is to advance the way we interact with computers, 
          taking inspiration from how humans communicate and collaborate. In particular, 
          I’m interested in making computers capable of handling ambiguous inputs and 
          specifications by leveraging prior knowledge, context and interaction.

          I am interested in understanding how language enables humans to work together 
          effectively. My current research focuses on indirect language use and teaching.

          I am excited about how we can build models that are able to reason better by learning 
          to model the world and leverage structural understanding, such as in multi-step planning, 
          intermediate rationales, object-centric visual representations, or theory of mind and 
          social reasoning.

          I am primarily interested in understanding meta-learning and in-context learning in humans and language models. In language models, I work on developing a theoretical understanding of training dynamics and generalization. In humans, I aim to use insights gained from studying language models, as well as behavioral experiments, to inform theories of learning throughout development, domain generality, and reasoning.

          I'm interested in developing methods for more reliable forms of human-AI interaction, particularly in domains such
          as education, as well as exploring how users develop "trust"  in artificial agents over time.

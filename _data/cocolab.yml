          I currently work on reasoning (e.g., social, causal) in both humans and language models.
          During my PhD, I've worked on concept learning and social learning in multi-player games.

          My research goal is to advance the way we interact with computers, 
          taking inspiration from how humans communicate and collaborate. In particular, 
          I’m interested in making computers capable of handling ambiguous inputs and 
          specifications by leveraging prior knowledge, context and interaction.

          I am excited about how we can build models that are able to reason better by learning 
          to model the world and leverage structural understanding, such as in multi-step planning, 
          intermediate rationales, object-centric visual representations, or theory of mind and 
          social reasoning.

          I am interested in how we can build machines that can learn to communicate with humans 
          and other machines in a way that is interpretable and robust to uncertainty.

          I'm interested in developing methods for more reliable forms of human-AI interaction, particularly in domains such
          as education, as well as exploring how users develop "trust"  in artificial agents over time.

          My research is aimed at understanding the key ingredients of sample-efficient 
          reinforcement learning. Currently, I examine how information theory might be a useful 
          tool for facilitating this understanding, with a focus on abstractions and natural 
          language.

          My research interests are in operationalizing language for machine
          learning. This involves (1) building machines that can learn from
          (and teach with) language and interactive dialog, and (2) using
          language as a structured and compositional guide for learning.

          My research goal is to advance the way we interact with computers, taking inspiration from how humans communicate and collaborate. In particular, I’m interested in making computers capable of handling ambiguous inputs and specifications by leveraging prior knowledge, context and interaction.

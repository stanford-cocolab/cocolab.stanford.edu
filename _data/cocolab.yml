          My research interests are in operationalizing language for machine
          learning. This involves (1) building machines that can learn from
          (and teach with) language and interactive dialog, and (2) using
          language as a structured and compositional guide for learning.

          My research goal is to advance the way we interact with computers, 
          taking inspiration from how humans communicate and collaborate. In particular, 
          Iâ€™m interested in making computers capable of handling ambiguous inputs and 
          specifications by leveraging prior knowledge, context and interaction.

          My research is aimed at understanding the key ingredients of sample-efficient 
          reinforcement learning. Currently, I examine how information theory might be a useful 
          tool for facilitating this understanding, with a focus on abstractions and natural 
          language.

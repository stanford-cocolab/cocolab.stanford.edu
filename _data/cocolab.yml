          My research interests are in operationalizing language for machine
          learning. This involves (1) building machines that can learn from
          (and teach with) language and interactive dialog, and (2) using
          language as a structured and compositional guide for learning.

          My research goal is to advance the way we interact with computers, 
          taking inspiration from how humans communicate and collaborate. In particular, 
          I’m interested in making computers capable of handling ambiguous inputs and 
          specifications by leveraging prior knowledge, context and interaction.

          I am excited about how we can build models that are able to reason better by learning 
          to model the world and leverage structural understanding, such as in multi-step planning, 
          intermediate rationales, object-centric visual representations, or theory of mind and 
          social reasoning.

          My research is aimed at understanding the key ingredients of sample-efficient 
          reinforcement learning. Currently, I examine how information theory might be a useful 
          tool for facilitating this understanding, with a focus on abstractions and natural 
          language.
